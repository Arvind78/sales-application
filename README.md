# Sales Management Application

This is a sales management application built using React.js for a consumer goods manufacturing company. The application helps manage product inventory by generating sale orders for retailers or distributors. It includes features such as user authentication, theme toggling, and managing active and completed sale orders.

## Features
1. **Single Page Application**: The app is a SPA with a login page requiring a dummy username and password. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
2. **Dark Theme Toggle Switch**: The application includes a toggle switch for dark theme, with the selected theme persisting across reloads.
3. **Active and Completed Sale Orders**: The app has two tabs to manage active and completed sale orders.
4. **Sale Order Creation**: A button to create a new sale order, which triggers a modal with a form to enter the sale order details.
5. **Edit Sale Order**: An option to edit existing active sale orders using a modal with pre-filled details. For completed sale orders, the form is read-only.
